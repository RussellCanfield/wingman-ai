# Installation & Requirements

Wingman is a Node-based CLI and gateway. This repository uses Bun for development.

## Requirements

- **Bun** (recommended): the repo pins `bun@1.1.42` in `package.json`.
- **Node.js**: required to run the CLI and gateway in production environments.

## Install dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

## Run the gateway + UI locally

```bash
bun run dev
```

This starts the gateway and the Control Core UI in watch mode.

## Run the CLI directly from the repo

```bash
./bin/wingman --help
```

If you are installing Wingman globally via npm or another package manager, you can invoke `wingman` directly after installation.
