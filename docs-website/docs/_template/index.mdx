# Welcome to Wingman

Wingman is a two-part agent ecosystem:

- **Wingman CLI** for local orchestration, config, and agent execution.
- **Wingman Gateway** for multi-agent collaboration, sessions, adapters, and the Control Core web UI.

This documentation dives deep into configuration, providers, and real-world use cases so you can ship a production-grade Wingman setup.

## What you can build

- A **multi-agent coding squad** that delegates tasks across specialized sub-agents.
- A **Discord bot** that routes mentions to specific agents and session threads.
- A **voice-enabled command center** using Web Speech or ElevenLabs.
- A **shared gateway** for cross-device collaboration and session persistence.

## Where to start

1. Run `wingman init` to generate a `.wingman/` workspace config.
2. Configure providers (`wingman provider login <provider>`).
3. Create or customize agents in `.wingman/agents/`.
4. Start the gateway and open the Control Core UI.
