# Skills

Skills extend Wingman with reusable workflows. Wingman can browse and install skills from a GitHub repository.

## Commands

```bash
wingman skill browse
wingman skill install pdf
wingman skill list
wingman skill remove pdf
```

## Configuration

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "repositoryOwner": "anthropics",
    "repositoryName": "skills",
    "githubToken": "optional-token",
    "skillsDirectory": "skills"
  }
}
```

You can also set `GITHUB_TOKEN` for higher GitHub API rate limits.

## Where skills live

Installed skills are placed in `.wingman/skills/` (or the directory you configure). Each skill includes a `SKILL.md` with metadata and instructions.
