# Skills

Skills extend Wingman with reusable workflows. Wingman can browse and install skills from GitHub or ClawHub.

## Commands

```bash
wingman skill browse
wingman skill install pdf
wingman skill list
wingman skill remove pdf
```

## Configuration

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "provider": "github",
    "repositoryOwner": "anthropics",
    "repositoryName": "skills",
    "githubToken": "optional-token",
    "clawhubBaseUrl": "https://clawhub.ai",
    "skillsDirectory": "skills",
    "security": {
      "scanOnInstall": true,
      "scannerCommand": "uvx",
      "scannerArgs": ["--from", "mcp-scan>=0.4,<0.5", "mcp-scan", "--json", "--skills"],
      "blockIssueCodes": ["MCP501", "MCP506", "MCP507", "MCP508", "MCP509", "MCP510", "MCP511"]
    }
  }
}
```

Provider notes:
- `provider: "github"` uses `repositoryOwner` and `repositoryName`.
- `provider: "clawhub"` uses `clawhubBaseUrl`.
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` is still supported for GitHub API rate limits.

Security scan notes:
- Skill installs are staged, validated, scanned, and only then copied into the active skills directory.
- Default scanner execution uses `uvx` + `mcp-scan`.
- Wingman checks for `uv` only when `skills.security.scanOnInstall` is enabled and the scanner command is `uv`/`uvx`.

## Where skills live

Installed skills are placed in `.wingman/skills/` (or the directory you configure). Each skill includes a `SKILL.md` with metadata and instructions.
