# Wingman Documentation
Wingman AI is a multi-agent system with a local CLI control plane, a gateway for orchestration and persistent sessions, and a desktop companion + Control Core UI for multi-client access. This documentation covers setup, configuration, agents and sub-agents, Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, skills, hooks, voice (TTS), Discord integration, webhooks, routines, and the gateway HTTP API.

## Start Here
- https://docs.getwingmanai.com/ : Product overview, architecture context, and navigation for all docs.
- https://docs.getwingmanai.com/getting-started/quickstart : 4-step bootstrap (init workspace, login provider, start gateway, run an agent).
- https://docs.getwingmanai.com/getting-started/installation : Requirements (Bun/Node), install deps, run gateway + UI, run CLI from repo.

## Core Concepts (Short)
- Gateway = collaboration hub for routing, sessions, adapters, and Control UI.
- Agents live in `.wingman/agents/<id>/` as `agent.json` or `agent.md`.
- Sessions persist in `.wingman/wingman.db` with stable session keys.
- Dynamic UI (SGUI) renders registered components via `ui_*` tools.
