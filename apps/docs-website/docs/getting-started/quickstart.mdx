# Quickstart

This guide gets you from zero to a running Wingman setup with a gateway, configured provider, and a starter agent.

## 0) Install Wingman

Choose one option:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://getwingmanai.com/install.sh | bash
```

or

```bash
npm install -g @wingman-ai/gateway
```

The install script runs `wingman init` for you. If you use npm, continue to step 1.

## 1) Initialize a workspace

From the root of your project:

```bash
wingman init
```

This creates `.wingman/wingman.config.json` and installs a starter agent in `.wingman/agents/`.

You can choose bundled agents during setup:

```bash
wingman init --agents main,coding,stock-trader
```

## 2) Configure a model provider

Either set an env var or store credentials:

```bash
# Example: OpenAI
wingman provider login openai
```

Wingman stores credentials in `~/.wingman/credentials.json` by default. You can also configure via env vars.

## 3) Start the gateway

```bash
wingman gateway start
```

Defaults:

- **Gateway WebSocket:** `ws://127.0.0.1:18789/ws`
- **Control UI:** `http://127.0.0.1:18790/`

## 4) Invoke an agent

```bash
wingman agent --agent wingman "Summarize the repo architecture."
```

Use `--local` to bypass the gateway and run locally:

```bash
wingman agent --agent wingman --local "Refactor the config loader."
```

## Next steps

- Configure providers and model strings in detail.
- Create custom agents and sub-agents.
- Enable adapters like Discord or Voice.
- Add MCP servers and skills.
