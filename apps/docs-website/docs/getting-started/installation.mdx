# Installation & Requirements

Wingman is a Node-based CLI and gateway. This repository uses Bun for development.

## Install Wingman

### Install script (recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://getwingmanai.com/install.sh | bash
```

The script installs the CLI via Bun (if available) or npm, then runs `wingman init`.

### npm (global)

```bash
npm install -g @wingman-ai/gateway
wingman init
```

## macOS App (Menu Bar Companion)

Wingman also ships a native macOS menu bar app for voice capture and quick
handoff to the Gateway.

- Download the latest notarized build from
  [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/RussellCanfield/wingman-ai/releases/latest/download/WingmanMacOS.zip).
- Requires macOS 13+.
- Configure the Gateway URL + optional auth in the app settings.

## Desktop Companion (Tauri Preview)

Wingman also includes a standalone desktop companion app (Tauri-based) with a
React + Tailwind shell for native tray actions, recording overlay, and gateway
routing, with a macOS-first adapter rollout before Windows parity.

- Source location: `apps/windows`
- Configure the Gateway URL + optional auth in app settings
- Desktop workspace includes:
  - gateway connection test
  - session list and session management
  - agent selection and new agent creation
  - rich streamed chat rendering with structured UI blocks
- Dev command: `bun run --cwd apps/windows tauri:dev`

## Requirements (development)

- **Bun** (recommended): the repo pins `bun@1.1.42` in `package.json`.
- **Node.js**: required to run the CLI and gateway in production environments.

## Install dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

## Run the gateway + UI locally

```bash
bun run dev
```

This starts the gateway and the Control Core UI in watch mode.

## Run the CLI directly from the repo

```bash
./bin/wingman --help
```

If you are installing Wingman globally via npm or another package manager, you can invoke `wingman` directly after installation.
