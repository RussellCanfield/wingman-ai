# Installation & Requirements

Wingman is a Node-based CLI and gateway. This repository uses Bun for development.

## Install Wingman

### Install script (recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://getwingmanai.com/install.sh | bash
```

The script installs the CLI via Bun (if available) or npm, then runs `wingman init`.

### npm (global)

```bash
npm install -g @wingman-ai/gateway
wingman init
```

## Desktop Companion (macOS + Windows x64 in progress)

Wingman ships a standalone Desktop Companion app (Tauri-based) with native tray
actions, recording overlay, gateway chat workflows, and session mirroring with
the Control Core web UI.

- Download from
  [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/RussellCanfield/wingman-ai/releases).
- Current packaged releases target macOS (Apple Silicon).
- Windows x64 build + installer automation exists for internal rollout and CI validation.
- Windows recording currently supports manual transcript entry while native speech capture parity is in progress.
- Configure the Gateway URL + optional auth in app settings.

- Source location: `apps/desktop`
- Configure the Gateway URL + optional auth in app settings
- Desktop workspace includes:
  - gateway connection test
  - session list and session management
  - mirrored live session streams between desktop and Control Core web UI for the same session
  - agent selection and new agent creation
  - provider credential management (including voice providers)
  - configurable voice defaults and playback policy
  - assistant message voice playback (manual and per-session auto-speak)
  - rich streamed chat rendering with structured UI blocks
- Dev command: `bun run --cwd apps/desktop tauri:dev`
- Windows publish automation: `bun run --cwd apps/desktop publish:windows`

## Legacy macOS Menu Bar App

The legacy native menu bar app still exists in this repository while the
Desktop Companion rollout continues.

- Source location: `apps/macos`

## Requirements (development)

- **Bun** (recommended): the repo pins `bun@1.1.42` in `package.json`.
- **Node.js**: required to run the CLI and gateway in production environments.

## Install dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

## Run the gateway + UI locally

```bash
bun run dev
```

This starts the gateway and the Control Core UI in watch mode.

## Run the CLI directly from the repo

```bash
./bin/wingman --help
```

If you are installing Wingman globally via npm or another package manager, you can invoke `wingman` directly after installation.
