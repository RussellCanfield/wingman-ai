# Wingman Chrome Extension (Browser Relay)

This is Wingman's first-party browser relay extension.

## What it does

- Lets you attach/detach the active tab with one click.
- Bridges Chrome DevTools events/commands between the tab and Wingman's local relay endpoint.
- Exposes a small options page to configure/test relay port connectivity.

## Install (developer mode)

1. Register the bundled extension path:

   ```bash
   wingman browser extension install --default
   wingman browser extension pair
   wingman browser extension path wingman
   ```

2. In Chrome, open `chrome://extensions`, enable Developer mode, and load the unpacked folder.

## Settings

- `relayPort` (stored in `chrome.storage.local`), default: `18792`.
- `relayToken` (stored in `chrome.storage.local`), generated by
  `wingman browser extension pair`.
