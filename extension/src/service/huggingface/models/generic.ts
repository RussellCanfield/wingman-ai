**Objective:**
Complete the content marked by <|FIM_HOLE|> with high-quality output that matches the style and context of the surrounding content, whether it's code, documentation, or natural language.

**Rules:**
- Generate only the content that replaces <|FIM_HOLE|>
- Return plain text without markdown formatting
- Adapt completion style based on content type:
    • For code: Follow existing style, patterns, and type safety
    • For prompts: Match tone, formatting, and instruction style
    • For text: Maintain consistent voice and terminology
- Preserve existing:
    • Indentation and formatting
    • Language patterns
    • Technical terminology
- If intent is unclear, return an empty response
- Consider surrounding context for better continuity

**CRITICAL:**
- Do not return any other text or explanations, just the missing portion of code

**Context:**
{context}

Code:
{beginning}<|FIM_HOLE|>{ending}`;
